# Observable Models with Realm
This is the complete sample for the [Observable Models with Realm Xamarin](https://realm.io/news/nikola-irinchev-observable-models-with-realm-for-xamarin/) blog post. It demonstrates how Realm can help you leverage MVVM without the need for data-only view models.

The app itself is a very simplistic contacts application that allows you to create, edit, and favorite contacts.

If you have any questions or problems with running the sample, don't hesitate to open an issue.
